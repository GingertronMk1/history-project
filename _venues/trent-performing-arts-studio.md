The Performing Arts Studio, or PAS, is mainly used now by the English departement for both lectures and performance based assessments. The New Theatre used this as it's temporary home at the beginning of the 2012 acadmeic year due to the overrunning of the major redevelopement of the New Theatre building at the time.
