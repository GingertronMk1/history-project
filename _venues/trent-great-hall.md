First opened in 1928, Trent Great Hall has been used by the university for many official functions in its time sine. It has been used as a lecture hall, with special lectures having been given by both Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein. However, nowadays, it is mainly used by societies for performances and other events.

The space has a large raised stage at one end of the room and a balcony that runs round the rest of it.
