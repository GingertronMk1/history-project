Theatre after show parties - all night, in the theatre. Wednesday afternoons rehearsing, followed by an evening in the Buttery bar. Amazing friendships, a second family. Much more fun than doing my degree.

Still involved in amateur dramatics and have my own business consulting and freelancing in marketing and change projects.
