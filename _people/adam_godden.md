I was heavily involved with the New Theatre as soon as I joined the university in September 1999 for about 2 years, and less so during my final 2 years. Mostly doing lighting, but also getting involved with most aspects of backstage. When I first arrived there was a storeroom full of broken lights. Along with the current lighting manager and a few 'willing' volunteers, we got pretty much everything fixed and working in time for the first show I lit - Little Voice. The show was set over 3 levels, obviously burnt down, and his love of pigeons was replaced by a love of lights, as a result there were many comments along the lines of 'we've never seen so many lights in the roof'! Much fun was had :o) Other notable highlights were the many and various shows written by Ben Richards which were always great fun to watch and work on.

Before I even graduated I started to freelance as a lampy/all rounder and have continued to do so! I never got as far as finding a job or choosing a career. I now mostly doing lighting in the corporate sector as I followed the money and not my heart. I would dearly love to get involved with theatre again should time ever permit.
