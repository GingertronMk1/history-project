In general, working with so many talented and aspiring actors, directors, practitioners was a pleasure. More specifically, Ben Richards's delivery of the line "Where's the whore?" in The Homecoming. People involved in the New Theatre certainly knew how to throw a party and have a good time after a show; but at one rehearsal for Amadeus it all became too much and Henry and I got in trouble with Jen for smoking in the lighting box. Certainly wouldn't be allowed now (not that it was then, either).
