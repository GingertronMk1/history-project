The old New Theatre was a bit of a tip but gloriously free of anyone telling us what to do; the ideal place to make a mess of it and learn how to get it right. Perfect for parties, too.
I went on to the Drama Studio, Ealing, to take a one-year course in theatre directing, then I worked in small scale theatre, mainly with the Women's Theatre Group and Theatre Venture in Newham. Then I joined the BBC as a script editor, working in comedy and drama, and later wrote for Crossroads. Recently I have been a creative writing tutor for the Open University and had a novel published, 'All to Play For'.
