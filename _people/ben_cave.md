Without a doubt the parachute pants I wore in Romeo and Juliet. They were brilliant. Incredibly flattering. The cast parties in Savera after the first night and then Church House off Lenton Boulevard after the final show. I also broke Nick Medhurst's nose in the middle of a show once. He was a true pro though, following through despite gushing blood!

I now coach people on the use of open data for the Open Data Institute.
