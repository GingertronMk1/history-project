The New Theatre was like my second home, I loved and adored everyone there and it really shaped my entire university life.

After graduating I worked at Lakeside Arts on New Street Theatre's Into the Woods as AD, I moved to NY and worked on multiple productions in Albany New York before moving back to England. I am now a manager at a Montessori School in Yorkshire.
