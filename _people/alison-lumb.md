I was a member of NTG 1978-79, going with them to the Edinburgh Fringe for two seasons, summer 78 and 79.
I was an assistant stage manager initially, then pianist in the band for various shows in Edinburgh and around campus.
 
Thanks to that  life-changing experience, I avoided a career as an archivist in the basement of the arts library, and after a few years of dogsbody jobs, worked at  the BBC/ITV etc as an assistant floor manager, script editor, producer and executive producer, from 1981 until around 2009.
