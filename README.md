# New Theatre History Project

The Alumni Network was founded in order to build a stronger sense of the history of the theatre, and with the launch of "The New Theatre History Project" we are hoping to do just that!

Following recent meetings with the staff at the Nottingham University Archives we are starting this project to piece together the many different aspects and parts of the New Theatreâ€™s dynamic and vibrant history.
