# What is The Nottingham New Theatre? 

The Nottingham New Theatre is a playhouse and production company based on University Park campus, Nottingham, England. It is funded in part by the University of Nottingham Students' Union and constitutes one of the Union's Media Groups (alongside University Radio Nottingham, Nottingham Student Television Station, Impact Magazine, and TEC PA and Lighting). 

It is the only entirely student-run theatre in England, with around 25 individual shows across two seasons per academic year, spanning 6 performances a week, to total around 100 live performances every year.

With a long and rich history, the Nottingham New Theatre has had a steady stream of members through its doors across many departments for the last 70 years.
