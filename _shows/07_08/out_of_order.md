It's 1991. Richard Willey MP is a member of the Conservative Cabinet. He is at the Westminster Hotel seducing Jane Worthington, one of the Leader of the Opposition's secretaries. Her suspicious husband, Ronnie, has been having her followed by a private detective, and is out to catch the man she's playing away with. Richard's secretary, George Pigden, comes to save the day, but accidentally gets married. On top of all this, Richard's wife turns up and ends up having a fling with George by mistake, but not before Ronnie has a break-down and admits his inadequacies...

Does it all make sense in the end? Of course not! Out of Order is one of Ray Cooney's best loved comedies, and was the winner of the 1991 Olivier Award for Comedy of the Year.
