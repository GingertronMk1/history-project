Do you like murder, intrigue and suspense? Do you like to control events and imagine yourself as some sort of all-powerful demi-God? If so then we think you might enjoy this...

Student Improv Nottingham presents an intriguing twist upon the classic murder-mystery; an unfinished tale, governed not by reason or logic, but YOU, the audience. Part written, part improvised, you decide the culprit - and then we improvise the rest.

A gripping story, replete with lonely soliloquies, clueless characters and gaping plotholes, The Cranberry Chamber promises to be a compelling comic caper, deadly fun for all the family or co-habiting student household.

Who dunnit? You decide...
