The story of a young teenage couple who deliberately encase themselves in a giant concrete box. As people on the outside try to force their way in, Jess and James make the walls thicker, and the two explore their own stories, their thoughts and feelings about love, and the terrifying and traumatic events that lead them to build 'the box'. A dark, macabre and often grotesque story about how sometimes love will always prevail, even if it means isolation, and possible death.
