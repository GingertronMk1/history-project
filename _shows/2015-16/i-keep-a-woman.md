Socially-awkward Stephen is a twenty-something we can all relate to. Heâ€™s hopelessly lonely, he hates his job and he keeps a woman shackled to his plumbing. But tonight is different. Tonight Stephen is preparing for a hot date with the help of the female manacled to his water main. They discuss everything from Sandra Bullock to white privilege and the sex appeal of investment bankers, but never mention the elephant in the room. A hilarious, fast-paced, black comedy about a kidnapper and his victim. Winner of East 15 Graduate Award 2015.
