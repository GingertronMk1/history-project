In 1922, New York reaches boiling point: parties are longer, morals are looser, liquor is stronger and jazz is hotter. When impressionable Nick Carraway arrives to seek his fortune, he is drawn into the decadent, hedonistic world of Americaâ€™s elite. But when tragedy strikes, he is forced to decide whether money matters more than his morality.
