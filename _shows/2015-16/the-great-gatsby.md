In the Summer of 1922, New York reaches boiling point: the parties are longer, the morals are looser, the liquor is stronger and the jazz is hotter. Nick Carraway, a young Yale graduate and veteran of the First World War, arrives from the Midwest to seek his fortune. He is soon drawn into the decadent, hedonistic world of Americaâ€™s richest, but when tragedy strikes, Nick is forced to decide whether money matters more to him than his morality. Featuring dance and physical theatre, this is a sharp, vibrant and dynamic new adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written.
