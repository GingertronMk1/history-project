A fictional biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, based on fact and conspiracies surrounding the nature of his relationship with his muse, Alice Liddell. Out of Wonderland shows snapshots of Charles Dodgson’s life (Carroll’s) over 2 years as he attempts to juggle his personal relationships, working relationships and mental torment, at the same time as writing his classic fantasy for his ‘child-friend’.
