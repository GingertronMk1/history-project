'It’s not business– it’s personal.' Spawn of the West End Reviews, headed by the conscienceless Keira Cochrane, make Edinburgh a miserable place to be during Fringe month. The city is rife with bribery, corruption and generically angsty student shows. So when the Critic with No Name rides into town with a new brand of objective critique, sparks will fly as thick and fast as the vindictively-worded reviews. Parodying everything from Les Miserables to Dirty Harry, The Reviewers is an irreverent new musical comedy that’ll make you ask yourself one question: Are you feeling objective? Well, are you punk?
