Sarah Kane is one of the most controversial and ground-breaking new playwrights of the late 20th Century. Inspired by Bond, Artaud, Beckett and Pinter, Sarah Kane represents athe new wave of British Contemporary playwrights. Her final play, 4.48 Psychosis was performed posthumously folowing her tragic suicide in 1999 and represents the culmination of her quest for new forms of theatre based on viceral personal expereince. A stark experience of the internal world of a clinical depressive on the verge of suicide, 4.48 Psychosis is viewed as aone of the most challenging works to have come out of Britain in the 1990s.
