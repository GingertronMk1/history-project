A pretentious director, moronic cast and a gender-bending, meta-theatrical mess of a production of The Merchant of Venice, merge in this satirical antidote to everything waffling, affected or ostentatious about the Stage - just what the doctor ordered, darling.

Cast Aside, by New Theatre's very own Charlie Brafman, enjoyed a sell-out run at last year's Edinburgh Fringe. They got a four star review from Three Weeks, a major Fringe review newspaper. Some proceeds from ticket sales will go towards the New Theatre Edinburgh Fringe fund.
