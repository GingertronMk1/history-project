"Shocking" plays from the Victorian era often don't seem that shocking ot modern audiencs, but who wouldn't be shoked to find out htat not only is their mother a prostitute, they could be engaged to their own brother? A witty and hard hitting play about the world's oldest profession that was banned for 35 years. The cast includes a sleazy vicar, a turn of the century pimp , the most unromatnic heroine you've ever seen, and of course, Mrs Warren herself.
