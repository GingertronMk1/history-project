Rough Theatre II and Ohio Impromptu represent Beckett's early and late career respectively. The plays vary in their style enormously, however what ties them together is the way Beckett manages to present the predicament of humanity itself with humour and indescribable beauty.

Rough Theatre II is a darkly comic play about the futility of life and the ways in which we manage to survive it. Ohio Impromptu is a play whose visual power is only enhanced by the beauty of its words and through some strange devie manages to comfort us.
