Eric Swan, a crafty benefit fraudster, has been playing the benefit system for years, inventing a whole canon of relatives and mysterious illnesses to maximise his income. But when he tries to start untangling his web of lies, he is forced to weave more, leading to a hilarious, farcical concoction of disguises, mistaken identities, misunderstandings and a very angry washing machine.
