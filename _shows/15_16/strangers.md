Strangers is a unique style of performance, blending magic and theatre to create a new artistic medium. In the way a musical tells a story with the help of music and lyrics this tells a story with the help of tricks and illusions. When seven strangers each encounter a magical set of pan pipes they think all their dreams have come true. However, the mind reader, childrenâ€™s entertainer, restaurant server, gambler, couple on a first date, and television presenter find out that fame, fortune and freedom come at a cost. One that each character will come to deeply regret.
