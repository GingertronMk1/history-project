Shopping and F***ing explores what is possible if consumerism supersedes all other moral codes. To this affect everything, including sex, violence and drugs, is reduced to a mere transaction in an age where shopping centres are the new cathedrals of Western Consumerism. The first play in the history of theatre to become world-famous because of its title, it is a shocking morality tale of our amoral times, a unique stage portrait of a lost generation of dehumanised youth rotted by social and economic abuse.
