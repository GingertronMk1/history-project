Ambergate Reservoir is a cathartic female monologue concerned with relationships, loneliness and the routines of modern, suburban life. This exciting piece of contemporary theatre involves audience participation, food preparation and an awareness of performance conventions. Christine is a divorced parent, who begins the show by befriending an audience member and making tea for them. She describes several events from her past, connecting them with the life she leads now. There are several light-hearted moments, such as dancing to ABBA music and eating a sandwich in the audience, as well as hard-going confessions and direct questions. The play has a nostalgic tone, inviting audience members to question the way they live their own lives.
