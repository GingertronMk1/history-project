Beirut, the height of the Lebanon hostage crisis. An American doctor, an Irish journalist, and an English academic are stuck together in a cell, held captive by terrorists. While at first the three display their national biases and prejudices, their resentments and recriminations give way to an acknowledgment of each others’ characters, strengths, and weaknesses. As they learn that humour is their surest weapon against their demise, they must walk the delicate tightrope between keeping each other alive, and destroying each others’ sanity. Through imaginary films, throwing big parties for each other, and fantastical games of tennis, they learn to lament what was lost in their lives before captivity, and hope to achieve their ultimate goal - survival.
