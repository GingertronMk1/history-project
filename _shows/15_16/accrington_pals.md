For women on the Home Front, the First World War offered both opportunities and struggles that no-one had faced before. Contrasting the experiences of women to that of men, The Accrington Pals centres around a young woman called May and her relationship with her co-worker Eva and the man May loves, Tom. Dealing with the realities of the modern world and what it brings for women, May and the other residents of Accrington, both on the Home Front and at war, are left forever changed by one of the most poignant moments in human history. For the town of Accrington especially, the First World War will leave a mark that will not be forgotten for generations.
