A shipwreck. An island. An adventure. Dark magic swells as the waves crash around them. The Tempest is an amazing play with a huge number of parts available. This open air performance will allow actors the chance to engage with intriguing characters, get to grips with physical theatre and have a great time in the last Uncut production of the year!
