Whether you admit it or not, everyone likes being told they are beautiful. But what would happen if you met someone who was obsessed with your body?

'A Beautiful Thing' invites the audience to participate in a story about an artist and the life models he becomes infatuated with. It explores sexuality, invades your personal space and blurs the distinctions between love and desire. This show invites you to engage with characters that will surprise you, and questions the emotional attachments we form with our bodies. 'A Beautiful Thing' combines naturalism with improvised comedy to make an exciting piece of contemporary theatre.
