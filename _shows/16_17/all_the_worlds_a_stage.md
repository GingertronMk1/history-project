    quote: "The same five actors multi-role to create a fully fleshed-out universe, and each play their part with an absurd conviction that perfectly complements the surreal style of the show."

---
A director tries his hand at experimental theatre, to disastrous results. An incompetent doctor watches the auditions of a talent show, where the judges start an argument. A machine becomes sentient to the horror of a careers adviser. And a dictator has a friendly chat with the man he put in prison, only to discover that something is very, very wrong…

In a triple bill of absurdist theatre, these original short plays combine the farcical and the meta-theatrical, blurring the boundaries between reality and drama, between audience and actors.
