“What is the point of this stupid, painful life if not to be honest? If not to stand up for what one is in the core of one’s being?”

1958. Oliver is in love with Philip. Philip is in love with Oliver. Philip is married to Sylvia. Sylvia looks in the mirror and sees the face of a woman who has forgotten who she is.

2008. Philip is in love with Oliver. Oliver is in love with Philip. Oliver is addicted to anonymous sex. Sylvia can’t understand why Oliver enjoys sucking off Nazi rent boys.

Opposing a period of sexual repression with one of sexual revolt, this Olivier Award-winning play examines changing attitudes to sexuality, how the societies we live in shape our identities, and just how difficult it is to take pride in who we truly are.
