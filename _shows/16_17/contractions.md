Emma is settling into her new job but her seemingly friendly Manager is eerily concerned with her workplace relationships. When Emma becomes romantically involved with a co-worker, her Managerâ€™s tough stance on the relationship systematically strips Emma of her dignity, individuality, and ultimately her sanity.

Told through a series of one-on-one meetings, Contractions explores corporate intrusiveness, compliance and just how far a woman will go to keep her job in a tough economic climate.
