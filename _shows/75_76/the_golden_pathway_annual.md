For a boy growing up from the end of the Second World War to the late 1960s, the Golden Pathway Annual seemed to be the perfect companion. But oh, the contradictions that can wear out a grown-up person... For anyone who's been a child; re-live the experience of growing up, with Michael, his parents and the array of characters he meets along the way. Be prepared... education is a dangerous thing!
