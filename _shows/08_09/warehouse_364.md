An amalgam of razor sharp-witted new writing and devising, Warehouse 362 is delves into the murky waters of part-time prostitution (Tuesdays and Thursdays, not bank holidays). With a generous helping of Film Noir gangland underworlds, mysterious strangers and, of course, a warehouse (a big one), Warehouse 364 is rich, vibrant and at times downright trippy. Starring a prostitute.
